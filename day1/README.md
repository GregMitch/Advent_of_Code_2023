So I solved this one the messy way, I am aware that string substitution would be much cleaner.  

But I already got my stars so I'm not gonna change it >:)  

Dec3 Edit: Actually I avoided some weird edge cases (oneight) so I'm not sure how clean string substitution would be.
Probably still easier to read than what I did.
